# assembly
HW6main is the main file run by my instructor, which calls the function that is StudentCode; here is where I was permitted to write code. My code loaded a NOP and placed it in the location of the function call I wished to subvert. Then I used the stack to place the address of my string in the location HW6main expected my instructor's string. This was a lesson in stack smashing.
